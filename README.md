# Hello, Triangle!
This project uses OpenGL 4.6 to recreate the famous “Hello Triangle” OpenGL starter project in modern OpenGL. It aims to demonstrate the basic steps of setting up an OpenGL context, creating a window, loading shaders, and, most importantly, drawing a simple triangle on the screen!
